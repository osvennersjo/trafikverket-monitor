# Email Configuration for Notifications
# You can use Gmail SMTP or any other email provider

# For Gmail:
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=your.email@gmail.com

# For other email providers, adjust the SMTP settings accordingly
# Make sure to use app passwords for Gmail (not your regular password)

# To set up Gmail app password:
# 1. Go to your Google Account settings
# 2. Security -> 2-Step Verification (enable if not already)
# 3. App passwords -> Generate app password for "Mail"
# 4. Use that generated password in SMTP_PASSWORD
